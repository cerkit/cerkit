### 👋 Meet **cerkit**

🛠️ **Code-Crafter & Retro Tinkerer**  
Writes rock-solid C for Z80 machines ⚙️, hacks Verilog 💾, and architects modern .NET + MQTT backends—​all backed by meticulous docs, UML, and DevOps wiki pages.

🎛️ **Automation Advocate**  
Spins up Docker on Windows 🐳, wrangles Hugo sites ⚡, and scripts Blender Geometry Nodes 🐍 to keep repetitive work out of the creative lane.

🎶 **Ambient Alchemist**  
Composes focus-boosting soundscapes in Reason 13 & Logic Pro, releasing tracks like [*Oceania* on Bandcamp](https://cerkit.bandcamp.com/album/oceania) 🎧.

🖼️ **Visual Storyteller**  
Procedurally generates geometry, AI-assisted album art, and seamless looping animations—​dialing in aspect ratios, color palettes, and motion to pixel perfection 🌌.

🔁 **Iterative Perfectionist**  
Thrives on rapid feedback loops: build → refine → wow. Every project ships only when it *looks good, sounds good, and just works.*

> *“Automate the mundane so creativity can take center stage.”*
